This is an autosplitter for [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) and the split file I use for Happy's Humble Burger Farm Endless% speedruns. 

Simpy go to Edit Layout and add a Scritable Auto Splitter to your LiveSplit layout, set its Script Path to the .asl file, then go to Open Splits and open the .lss file
