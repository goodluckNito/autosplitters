This is an autosplitter for [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) and the split file I use for Happy's Humble Burger Farm Endless% speedruns. 

Simpy go to Edit Layout and add a Scriptable Auto Splitter to your LiveSplit layout, set its Script Path to the .asl file, then go to Open Splits and open the .lss file

If you have any issues you may need to put the [asl-help binary](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help/blob/main/lib/asl-help) in your LiveSplit/Components/ folder
